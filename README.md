# OSDev
This will have all the code related to OS Developement
This is the single repository where all the OS related work will be stored.


Here is the folder structre - 

1. Gyaan - Here I will have any documents related to Operating system. It can be written by me or got from some other source.

2. OtherOS - It will have any other OS which I am referencing for my development or other OS aprt from TestOS series which I develop examplement initial PLPOS development.

3. TestOS - This is the one which will house all my OS development. It will have series of folders like Test1OS, Test2OS, Test3OS... Now each incremental series indicates new knowledge which I acquired about OS and each OS will be higher version than previous.

Current OS development is Test3OS.

It is a basic kernel similar in architecture to Linux kernel. It is targeted for x86 architecture.
